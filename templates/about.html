	<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with
		Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long
		lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the
		Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had
		once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
		decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and
		cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone
		like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
		rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be
		an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
		business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>
